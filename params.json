{"name":"ESF MU Portal","tagline":"A project to provide a robust information system to students of Faculty of Economics and Administration.","body":"ESF MU Portal\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThis project is a combination of several diploma thesis on **Masaryk University** (http://www.muni.cz/) in \r\nBrno, Czech Republic. It's aim is to create an information portal for students of\r\n*Faculty of Economics and Administration*, providing them with valuable information and references. \r\nWhole website had to be reinvented and redesigned and will provide connection to an law information system\r\nASPI (http://www.systemaspi.cz/).\r\n\r\n**Drupal Website** (PHP) <=> **Guacamole Servlets** (JAVA) <=> **Guacamole Proxy** (C) <=> **ASPI** (RDP)\r\n\r\n**Apache** <=> **Apache Tomcat** <=> **Linux Service** <=> **ASPI**\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nDrupal Website\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nWhole site is build on Drupal CMS, using as much of it's features as possible. To make the whole process easier, Features module (https://drupal.org/project/features) is used to export configuration and content and then keep it in source control. This way, all the development can happen on a development environment and then be migrated into production.\r\n\r\nRemote desktop connection\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo connect to the third-party servers (ASPI), Guacamole (http://guac-dev.org/) is used. Being an open-source library designed to connect to remote desktop from any HTML5 compatible web browser, it allows us to minimize the requirements for the client environment and almost eliminates any client-side installation steps. It comes with it's own client, which was ported into a Drupal module. To enable it work this way, Guacamole's core JavaScript libraries had to be modified to support CORS (http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).\r\n\r\nSource structure\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- */doc* - documentation of the project\r\n- */src/main* - java application sources\r\n- */src/modules* - Drupal modules and features modules\r\n- */src/themes* - Drupal theme for the project \r\n- *build.xml* - Phing build file\r\n- *pom.xml* - Maven build file\r\n \r\nWhare next?\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* [Installation instructions](INSTALL.md)\r\n* [Changelog and Roadmap](CHANGELOG.md)\r\n* [Licence](LICENCE.md)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
