{"name":"Esf-mu-portal","tagline":"A project to integrate Guacamole with MUNI","body":"ESF MU Portal\r\n==============\r\n\r\nA project to implement a portal for ESF MU\r\n\r\nTechnologies\r\n------------\r\nCore functionality will be covered by implementing Guacamole (http://guac-dev.org/). \r\nIt is an open-source library designed to connect to remote desktop from any HTML5 compatible web browser\r\nthrough a JAVA based server running on Apache TomCat. This highly lowers the requirements for client computer\r\nand software, eliminating any required instalation steps for end users and providing seamless connection to \r\nthe remote machine. \r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nClient -> Tunnel -> Remote Desktop\r\n\r\nClient\r\n\r\nHTML5 Client (Browser) implemented as a Drupal module on the site (independend on client operating system, \r\npossibly usable on Android and IOS too).\r\n\r\nTunnel\r\n\r\nJAVA based tunnel application running on Linux which provides the tunneling functionality for the HTML5 client. \r\nIt runs as a service on Apache TomCat server.\r\n\r\nRemote Desktop\r\n\r\nAny kind of VNC or RDP protocol based server, which provides the end point we are connecting to.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n-------\r\n\r\nVersion 0.1 *(May 2013)*\r\n\r\n- [x] First functional version, ability to log in into remote machine from web using custom HTML5 client. \r\n- [x] Only running locally from one Virtual Machine to another. \r\n\r\nVersion 0.2 *(June 2013)*\r\n\r\n- [x] Drupal integration module is created.\r\n- [x] Remote client server running on a standalone server with designated port so that multiple computers can connect to it.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.3 *(July 2013)*\r\n\r\n- [x] Correct privilegies settings for the drupal module so that it can be integrated into the existing website\r\n- [x] Styling of the module to align with the page which it integrates with.\r\n\r\nInstalation\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nI have ever really tested this working on linux, but there should theoretically not be any problem running it on windows. \r\nI am not going to write the installation tutorial for it though, so if you'd like to try it, please go ahead. Steps \r\nshould be fairly similar.\r\n\r\nRequirements: Maven (http://maven.apache.org/), Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org), JAVA, JAVA JDK\r\n\r\nTo verify that your environment is ready for the installation, please check that following commands return valid results.\r\nAlso make sure you have the manager webapp contained in your tomcat installation.\r\n\r\nMaven ```mvn --version``` \r\nJAVA ```java -version``` version should be at least 1.5.x\r\nJAVA JDK ```echo $JAVA_HOME``` should display the location of the JAVA SDK\r\n\r\nBuild JAVA Servlet application\r\n\r\n1. Navigate into a folder where you'd like to install this piece of software\r\n2. Clone this repository ```git clone git@github.com:kanei/ESF-MU-Portal.git```\r\n3. Enter the cloned repository ```cd ESF-MU-Portal```\r\n4. Build the application ```mvn clean install```\r\n5. Check the ```target``` folder and make sure it contains the built application (war)\r\n\r\nDeploy the JAVA Servlet application\r\n\r\nI am using the Apache Tomcat Maven Plugin, so deployment should be very simple. All what is really needed is a setup\r\nfor the plugin, which is done by creating user credentials for the Manager and use them in Maven. \r\nEdit file ```%TOMCAT_PATH%/conf/tomcat-users.xml``` and setup your admin user.\r\n\r\n```xml \r\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\r\n<tomcat-users>\r\n  <role rolename=\"manager\"/>\r\n  <role rolename=\"admin\"/>\r\n  <user username=\"admin\" password=\"password\" roles=\"admin,manager\"/>\r\n</tomcat-users>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen edit file ```%MAVEN_PATH%/conf/settings.xml``` and add the same credentials. Also make sure that the id stays \r\nTomcatServer, otherwise it's not going to work (must be the same as in the pom.xml file).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<server>\r\n\t<id>TomcatServer</id>\r\n\t<username>admin</username>\r\n\t<password>password</password>\r\n</server>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can simply (re)deploy your project by running ```mvn tomcat7:(re)deploy```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
